        <h1>Taarlo</h1>

            We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day. <br>
            And in spring too I feel no different. <br>
            We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves <br>
            through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,
        </p>
        <p>
            that deepens in the cellar of the years. <br>
            We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente. <br>
            Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees <br>
            sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
            33, and in the midst of the dark wood <br>
            of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging, <br>
            at home in the woods and desolate at home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Will we one day, maybe, ever? <br>
            The summer is past, the hay-making is over. <br>
            The here is nowhere, and the now is never.
